## NPC Pedestrians

This file explains how npc pedestrians behave, what aspects are important, and how to configure them.

In the simulation view, they are represented as red dots with a line indicating their velocity and direction.

### About

The npc pedestrians use the Extended Social Force Model [[2]](#2).
It extends the vanilla social force model [[1]](#1) to simulate the walking behaviour
of pedestrians with social group interactions.

Implementations, which they are based off are [[3]](#3) and [[4]](#4)

### Forces

The Forces are divided into 3 categories:

- Classical: The classic social forcel model by [[1]](#1)
- Extended: The extended model by [[3]](#3)
- New: Newly implemented forces for this simulation

All Forces are summed in the end to determine the direction and the velocity.

#### Classical

*Located in the [forces.py](../fast-pysf/pysocialforce/forces.py) file.*

Desired Force:  
This force describes the pedestrians wish to reach a goal and is also called the acceleration force.  
It tries to accelerate the pedestrian in the right direction, if the pedestrian is moving towards the target at maximum speed, the force is zero.
When the destination is reached, a braking force is applied depending on the current velocity.

Social Force:  
This force represents the influence of other npc pedestrians in a specific radius.  
It tries to repel based on position, direction, and velocity differences, decaying exponentially.

Obstacle Force:  
This repulsive force is used to avoid immovable obstacles such as walls.
It uses the distance to the nearest point of the obstacle to calculate it's strength.

#### Extended

*Located in the [forces.py](../fast-pysf/pysocialforce/forces.py) file.*

Group Repulsive Force:  
This force models repulsive interactions between members of a group, by summing the relative position vectors of nearby members.


Group Coherence Force:  
This Force aims to keep the members of the group together, by pointing towards the centroid of the group

Group Gaze Force:  
This force aligns the pedestrian with with the members direction.

#### New

*Located in the [ped_robot_force.py](../robot_sf/ped_npc/ped_robot_force.py) file.*

Ped-Robot Force:  
This force is repulsive and causes pedestrians to avoid the robot.


### Behaviors

*Located in the [ped_behavior.py](../robot_sf/ped_npc/ped_behavior.py) file.*

FollowRouteBehavior:  
Pedestrians follow a fixed route and restart at the spawn when the route is finished. 
When this happens, the pedestrian starts a new trajectory, even though the ID is the same.

CrowdedZoneBehavior:  
Pedestrians try to reach a goal in a predefined zone, and when they reach it, they are redirected to a new goal within the zone without respawning at a different location.

### Configuration

(The most important ones)

*Located in the [sim_config.py](../robot_sf/sim/sim_config.py) file.*

- base configuration for the simulation
- e.g. pedestrian_radius = 0.4, peds_speed_mult = 1.3 (max_speed_multiplier)

*Located in the fast-pysf [config.py](../fast-pysf/pysocialforce/config.py) file.*

- base configuration for all the forces
- if group forces should be used

*Located in the [ped_population.py](../robot_sf/ped_npc/ped_population.py) file.*

- sidewalk_width: float = 3.0 -> Determine deviation at spawn
- initial_speed: float = 0.5, with the max_speed_multiplier it leads to a maximum speed of 0.65 m/s ~ 2.34 km/h
