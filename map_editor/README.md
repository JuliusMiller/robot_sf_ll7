This is a simple map editor from Marco who used pygame to create suitable .yaml files.

Extensive documentation can be found in [docs/MAP_EDITOR_USAGE.md](../docs/MAP_EDITOR_USAGE.md)

## SVG Map Parser

I prefer to use `robot_sf/nav/svg_map_parser.py`.

Look at `examples/svg_map_example.py` for an example of how to use it.
